\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of this Document}
The purpose of this document is to describe the design of the implementation for the Monster Mash group project, as described by the project requirements.\\

It should explain the system architecture, the significant modules of the system, and how they interact with each other to form a working implementation.

\subsection{Scope}
This document explains the chosen architectural design for the application, describes the significant modules that form as part of that design, and explains how they fulfil the functional requirements of the project specification.\\

The modules will be described to some level of detail, so that programmers have a basic understanding of those modules and how they fit into the system architecture and how they can program to them. It does not explicitly document every function or attribute of each module.\\

Diagrams will be included to show how these modules relate to and depend on each other.\\

Specific details of the implementation will be described in more detail, such as algorithms and the data model.


\subsection{Objectives}
To achieve the goals above, this document must meet the following objectives:
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe the architecture of the system, and the reasons for using it
\item List the major modules of the system, with short explanations of what their purpose is and how they will work
\item Use diagrams to explain the architecture and relationships and dependencies between significant modules
\item Prove that the design meets all of the functional requirements of the project specification
\item Explain specific details about the implementation, such as significant algorithms
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interface Descriptions}
Where classes are described in the document, an interface description may be included to describe the contents of the class.\\

An interface description describes a class as if it were a Java interface. They list the significant method signatures in the class (notably methods which are depended upon by other parts of the application), any other classes that the class depends on, any overridden method, significant annotations and comments where the method signatures are not self-explanatory. They do not include any method bodies. Also, no default constructors or \texttt{throws} declarations are included for the sake of clarity.
