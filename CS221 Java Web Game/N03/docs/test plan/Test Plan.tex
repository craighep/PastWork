\section{INTRODUCTION}
\subsection{Purpose of this Document}
The purpose of this document is to provide a high standard of testing planning documentation for the planned software. It will detail the proposed system tests, and how testing will be approached.
\subsection{Scope}
This document lays out the planning of our tests to be performed on the completed software. It describes the main stages of testing to be performed, along with what elements/ parts of the system will be tested. 
\\\\\
This document should be read by all project team members, and all should be familiar with the Quality Assurance Plan \cite{Software Engineering Group Projects. QA Plan.}.
\subsection{Objectives}
To describe the outline plan for testing and produce test specifications for the format of, and which information should be supplied in tests and test reports for every part of the system.
\clearpage


\section{RELEVANT QA  DOCUMENTS}
This document has been produced in accordance with the quality standards indicted in the QA Plan  \cite{Software Engineering Group Projects. QA Plan.}. They have been maintained throughout the document, such as indicted in the Operating Procedures and Configuration Management Standards document \cite{Software Engineering Group Projects. Operating Procedures and Configuration Management Standards.}. The layout and information in this document conforms to the general documentation standards \cite{Software Engineering Group Projects. General Documentation Standards.}.

\section{GENERAL APPROACH TO TESTING}
The testing performed will be used to establish the presence of any errors or defects in our program, and will also be useful concerning the operational usefulness.  We have also considered this because testing is solely used to detect errors and not correct them, that the function of correcting any errors should be left until after testing is completed and not when finding them. When errors are discovered, we will ensure that the correct reporting and change control procedures are followed as indicted in the operating Procedures and Configuration Management Standards document. \cite{Software Engineering Group Projects. Operating Procedures and Configuration Management Standards.}. All tests will then be repeated to ensure that they do not still occur. This is known as regression testing.
\\\\
Special consideration within the testing of our system should be placed with boundary testing, along with extreme situations. In such boundary testing, both the inner and outer values of the boundary should be tested. For example testing a user's monsters health could involve looking at the values of health for 0, 1, 99 and 100. This would ensure we could see what happens at each of these phases. In terms of extreme data being tested, this could be in places where illegal input might be allowed, and by testing an extremely small or large number, we will be able to view if the system deals with the input correctly and does not produce errors.
\\\\
Software within this project will be tested in three different testing levels: module, system and acceptance. Module testing being the first will involve the testing of a collection of related components (for example a package contain definitions of types and sub programs). Module testing will involve separating a module from the rest of the system, thus testing in isolation. The best way we could perform module testing for our system would involve the creation of JUnit classes which would instantiate each of the classes to be tested, allowing them to be broken down to their methods and overall operations. Because the Java EE we will be using allows more than one entrance into the class, simply creating a main method for each of these and testing would not be sufficient, hence using JUnit would be ideal for testing. Using JUnit for our tests has many advantages and reasons to be used: 

\begin{itemize}
\item JUnit allows us to test many aspects of data flow through our system: It will allow us to easily test null situations, or instances where users could place extreme or boundary data in.
\item It provides us with a test suite, again increasing the ease of testing our application as a whole, and seeing where any problems occur in any classes. 
\end{itemize}
Testing for our web application can also be done similarly to the JUnit style using open source testing software such as Apache JMeter, which can look at both static and dynamic web pages including the servlets and Java objects that the pages consist of. By testing our website using a software such as this, it will make sure we check our product to the maximum ensuring minimum errors and top efficiency.

Testing modules through JUnit will be left to the programmers and will not require such a formal test plan or specification.
\\\\
The next level of testing will be system testing, which will incorporate all the modules to be tested together to create a whole system test. It would be very desirable in our project to have the tests carried out by users not in our project team. 
\\\\
Finally, acceptance testing will be necessary to allow the client of our software to test the completed product, and ensuring that all tests pass, the client will agree to accept the product. This should be tested by the client in the presence of our group project team. In terms of any resources we could use through the testing of our project, SommerVille \cite{Software Engineering Ian Sommerville Addison-Wesley Harlow} could provide us with useful background information on module and system testing.
\clearpage

\section{TEST PLAN}
Because a test plan outlining what testing and when it will need to be completed is not necessary in this project, we will follow these steps to carry out our testing of the proposed system:
\begin{itemize}
\item Module testing will be completed by coders in the form of Unit (JUnit) tests that try all the different operations and behaviours of classes. These should be written before coding is completed.
\item System testing will be completed by writing a system testing specification during the design stage. This will cover all the functionality that is considered major. When our system is completed, we will provide a test report that will document any features that work incorrectly.
\end{itemize}

\section {TEST SPECIFICATIONS}
The purpose of a testing specification is to specify in good detail each system test that is to be executed as part of a formal test process. The test specification will cross-reference sections of the requirements specification for each feature being tested at the apparent time.
\\\\
Each test specification will have an introductory section followed by a collection of test procedures. The introduction section will have the same form as specified in the QA Document SE.QA.03 \cite{Software Engineering Group Projects. General Documentation Standards.}, and will include a list of which documents from where the test specification will be derived. 
\\\\
Each individual test is described in detail below, and specifies how each test will be carried out. The table of proposed tests is displayed on the following page:

\section{TEST RESULT REPORTING}
Details of test results will be maintained within a test report folder, consisting of two sections: module testing and system testing. Test reports will be held on the online SVN repository under a folder which the test results will be held as files. On completion of our tests, the results will be submitted with the final report as a test report \cite{Software Engineering Group Projects. Producing A Final Report.}.

\section{CONFIGURATIONS}
It is important that all the items which form our system that is tested is frozen into an identified configuration. The documents cross referenced in the test specification form part of the configuration. While tests are being carried out, testers must ensure that they have the correct version checked out.

\clearpage

\section{APPENDIX A- EXAMPLE TEST LOG FORM}
Log forms will be used to document failed and passed tests through our program, and placed in a directory of log forms. The following page shows an example log form to be used:
